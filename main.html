			<h1>Despicable Me 2</h1>
			<p class="movieDetail">After giving up his life of villainy, Gru has settled into a more domestic role: caring for his three adopted daughters — Margo, Edith and Agnes — and running a jelly-making business.However, when the villainous mutagen PX-41 (a powerful serum) is stolen, the director of the Anti-Villain League (AVL) recruits him to help track down the perpetrator. Gru reluctantly teams up with agent Lucy Wilde, posing undercover to investigate a string of clues that lead toward a mysterious figure known as “El Macho”. Along the way, Gru must balance his duties as a father, his past as a super-villain, and his growing feelings for Lucy, all while the Minions face a bizarre mutation threat.</p>
